# MaBoost
MaBoost is a binary and multiclass classification package in R.

It is based on boosting method and contains different classifiation algorithms including:
(I) sparseboost which uses a percentage of samples at each boosting round,
(II) max-margin which guarantees to return the optimal hypothesis in the sense of maximum margin and
(III) smooth boosting which put smoothness constraint on boosting weights
