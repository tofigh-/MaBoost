Multiclass and binary Boosting algorithms
}

\description{
\sQuote{maboost} is used to fit a variety stochastic boosting models for binary and multiclass responses 
as described in \emph{Boosting on grounds of online learning} by T. Naghibi, et al. (2014).
}
\usage{
maboost(x,...)

\method{maboost}{formula}(formula, data,test.x=NULL,test.y=NULL,breg=c("entrop","l2"),C50tree=FALSE,iter=100, nu, bag.frac=0.5,random.feature=TRUE,random.cost=TRUE,
           maxmargin=FALSE,smooth=FALSE,smoothfactor=1,sparse=T,sparsefactor=1,delta=10^(-10),verbose=FALSE,
           \dots,subset,na.action=na.rpart)

}

\arguments{
  \item{formula}{a symbolic description of the model to be fit.}
  \item{data}{dataframe containing variables and a column corresponding to class labels.}
  \item{test.x}{testing matrix of discriptors (optional)}
  \item{test.y}{vector of testing responses (optional)}
  \item{breg}{ breg="l2" (default) selects quadratic Bregman divergence and breg="entrop" uses KL-divergence which results ina adaboost-like algortihm (with a different choice of eta).}
  \item{C50tree}{flag to use C5.0 as the weakLearn. It is only recommended for multiclass setting where rpart maybe too weak to satisfy boostability condition }
  \item{iter}{number of boosting iterations to perform.  Default = 100.}
  \item{nu}{shrinkage parameter for boosting, default taken as 1. It is multiplied in eta and controls its largeness}
  \item{bag.frac}{sampling fraction for samples taken out-of-bag.  This allows one
                  to use random permutation which improves performance.}
  \item{random.feature}{flag to grow a random forest type trees.  If TRUE, at each round a small set of features (num_feat^.5) are selected to grow a tree. It generally speeds up the convergence specially for large data sets and improves the performance.}
  \item{random.cost}{flag to assign random costs to selected features. By assigning random costs (look at cost in rpart.control) to the selected features (if random.forest=TRUE) it tries to decorrelates the trees and usually in combination with random.feature it improves the generalization error.}
  \item{maxmargin}{ by setting it to TRUE, it guarantees that the margin of the final hypothesis converges to max-margin (at each round t, it divides the eta by t^.5)}
  \item{smooth}{flag to start smooth boosting. Only works for breg="l2" and for binary classification}
  \item{smoothfactor}{an integer between 1 to N (number of examples in data) and have to be set if smooth is TRUE. If smoothfactor=K then example weights w_i<=1/K and error epsilon<K/N}
  
  \item{sparse}{flag to start sparse boosting. Only works with breg="l2". It can be used for multiclass but it is kindo f meaning less since multiclass setting uses a weight matrix instead of weight vector and this matrix getting sparse does not results in sparsity of the weight vector (which is the sum over col. of the weight matrix)}
   \item{sparsefactor}{It is multiplied in the l1 penalizing term to increase the sparsity at the rist of divergence. Default is 1 which guarantees the convergence of boosting algorithm. }

  \item{subset}{an optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be
                used in the fitting process.}
  \item{na.action}{a function that indicates how to process \sQuote{NA} values.  Default=na.rpart for rpart and na.pass for C5.0.}
  \item{\dots}{arguments passed to \code{rpart.control} and \code{C50Control}.  For stumps, use \code{maxdepth=1,cp=-1,minsplit=0,xval=0}.
             \code{maxdepth} controls the depth of trees, and \code{cp}
	     controls the complexity of trees. For C5.0 use \code{CF,minCases} control the complexity and size of the tree. The smaller the CF is, the less complex the tree and the larger the minCases, the smaller the size of the tree }
}

\details{
This function directly follows the algorithms listed in \emph{\dQuote{Boosting on Grounds of Online Learning}}.

When using usage \sQuote{maboost(y~.)}:
  data must be in a data frame.  Response can have factor or numeric values (preferably factor form).
  missing values can be present in the descriptor data, whenever
  na.action is set to any option other than na.pass.
    
After the model is fit, \sQuote{maboost} prints 
  a summary of the function call, 
  the method used for boosting, 
  the number of iterations,
  the final confusion matrix (observed classification vs predicted classification; 
  labels for classes are same as in response),  
  the error for the training set, and testing, training , and kappa estimates of the 
  appropriate number of iterations.

  A summary of this information can also be obtained with the command \sQuote{print(x)}.

  Corresponding functions (Use help with summary.maboost, predict.maboost, \dots
  varplot.maboost for additional information on these commands):

  summary :  function to print a summary of the original function call, method
                 used for boosting, number of iterations, final confusion matrix,
                 accuracy, and kappa statistic (a measure of agreement between
                 the observed classification and predicted classification).
                 \sQuote{summary} can be used for training, testing, or
		 validation data.  
		 

  predict :  function to predict the response for any data set (train,
  test, or validation)

  
  varplot.maboost :  plot of variables ordered by the variable importance measure (based on improvement).

 
  update : add more trees to the \code{maboost} object.

\value{
  \item{model}{
    The following items are the different components created by the algorithms:
    trees:  ensemble of rpart or C5.0 trees used to fit the model

            testing sums.

Special thanks to Dr. Mark Culp and his colleagues who developed the 'ada' package. a big part of this packge has been built upon their codes particularly  summary, print and varplot.maboost functions are imported from 'ada' package with almost no changes. For further info about 'ada' which implements different variations of Anyboost, look at [2]

\section{Warnings}{
  (a) only maxmargin flag makes sense to be set for multiclass setting.
  
  (b) cost variable in rpart.control is the only variable in rpart.control that CANNOT be set through maboost. It is reserved for random.cost.
